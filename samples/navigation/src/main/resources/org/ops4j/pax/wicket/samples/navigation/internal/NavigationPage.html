        <h3>Plain</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        <a href="../plain/simple">This example</a> is almost the most simple example possible. It does not require
        anything else than an Activator, the application and a page. You should feel quite home.
        <h3>Blueprint</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        The simple examples for blueprint consist of two parts. The one which could be found at <a href="../blueprint/simple/default">here</a>
        and the other one which is based on the pax-wicket spring namespace <a href="../blueprint/simple/paxwicket">here</a>.
        <h4>Injection</h4>
        The blueprint injection model is quite simple. Any bean in the local blueprint context (which is automatically generated from all 
        .xml files in your OSGI-INF/blueprint directory) can be injected by using it's name. It is NOT possible to inject a bean by type here.
        Please point your browser <a href="../blueprint/injection/simple">here</a> for the example.
        <h3>Spring DM</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        The simple examples for springDM consist of two parts. The one which could be found at <a href="../springdm/simple/default">here</a>. This
        example does not require to use the pax-wicket specific namespace. The other example, which is based on the pax-wicket spring namespace is
        available here <a href="../springdm/simple/paxwicket">here</a>.
        <h4>Injection</h4>
        The SpringDM injection model is quite simple. Any bean in the local Spring context (which is automatically generated from all 
        .xml files in your META-INF/spring directory) can be injected by using it's name or type only. 
        Please point your browser <a href="../springdm/injection/simple">here</a> for the example.
        <h3>Mixed Example</h3>
        This example avoids to show all features of PAX Wicket to reduce the complexity. Still it shows one of the most attractive features
        for most people. It has one API package and three other packages. The main package starts a wicket application and imports
        on factory service for page-links and one for components. Both are shown in ListViews on the page. This example shows how
        blueprint, springdm and plain osgi services could be combined. To see the the example point your browser 
        <a href="../mixed">here</a>.
