        <h3>Plain</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        <a href="../plain/simple">This example</a> is almost the most simple example possible. It does not require
        anything else than an Activator, the application and a page. You should feel quite home.
        <h3>Blueprint</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        The simple examples for blueprint consist of two parts. The one which could be found at <a href="../blueprint/simple/default">here</a>
        and the other one which is based on the pax-wicket spring namespace <a href="../blueprint/simple/paxwicket">here</a>.
        <h4>Injection</h4>
        The blueprint injection model is quite simple. Any bean in the local blueprint context (which is automatically generated from all 
        .xml files in your OSGI-INF/blueprint directory) can be injected by using it's name. It is NOT possible to inject a bean by type here.
        Please point your browser <a href="../blueprint/injection/simple">here</a> for the example.
        <h4>Mount Point</h4>
        This sample shows how mountpoints can be set. This will also work for spring or plain injection since only base methods are used. Point
        your browser here <a href="../blueprint/mount/automounted">here</a> for an automatic example and
        <a href="../blueprint/mount/manuallymounted">here</a> for a manual one.
        <h4>Filter</h4>
        This sample shows how fitlers could be set. This will also work for spring or plain injection since we directly integrate your filters.
        The only requirement is a filter factory or using the spring/blueprint namespaces for filters. Otherwise we do not know how to
        instance the filter. The blueprint sample is located <a href="../blueprint/filter/paxwicket">here</a>; the "plain" sample 
        <a href="../blueprint/filter/default">here</a>.
		<h4>Application Factory</h4>
		This sample shows how to reuse the same web application with different initialization parameters. <a href="../blueprint/applicationfactory/first">Here</a> you have the first instance and <a href="../blueprint/applicationfactory/second">here</a> the second instance of the same application initialized with different parameters.
        <h3>Spring DM</h3>
        <h4>Simple</h4>
        The simple examples for springDM consist of two parts. The one which could be found at <a href="../springdm/simple/default">here</a>. This
        example does not require to use the pax-wicket specific namespace. The other example, which is based on the pax-wicket spring namespace is
        available here <a href="../springdm/simple/paxwicket">here</a>.
        <h4>Injection</h4>
        The SpringDM injection model is quite simple. Any bean in the local Spring context (which is automatically generated from all 
        .xml files in your META-INF/spring directory) can be injected by using it's name or type only. 
        Please point your browser <a href="../springdm/injection/simple">here</a> for the example.
        <h3>Mixed Example</h3>
        This example avoids to show all features of PAX Wicket to reduce the complexity. Still it shows one of the most attractive features
        for most people. It has one API package and three other packages. The main package starts a wicket application and imports
        on factory service for page-links and one for components. Both are shown in ListViews on the page. This example shows how
        blueprint, springdm and plain osgi services could be combined. To see the the example point your browser 
        <a href="../mixed">here</a>.
        <h3>Edge Cases</h3>
        There are various situations where PAX WICKET has to deal with edge cases. To be able to analyse and have regression testss
        for those edge cases this sample suite had been created. If you're interested in the most extreme things you can do with
        PAX WICKET this section is definitely woth a try.
        <h4>Inherited Injection</h4>
        While direct injection from a local bundle is quite trivial it's something complete different if the parent requires injection
        from its own bundle and the page inheriting does also need this. It's becoming even more extreme if one bundle is Spring and one
        Blueprint. You'll be surprised but as you can see <a href="../edge/inheritinjection/">here</a> this really works.
